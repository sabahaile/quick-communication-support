# Phase 3 – Refinement and Future Work

## 3.1 Design Refinement
Based on Phase 2 feedback, future improvements include:
- Phrase personalisation based on user context
- Improved mobile-first layout
- Offline-access considerations
- Visual emphasis on low-cognitive-load interaction

---

## 3.2 Extended Evaluation
Future studies may include:
- Longitudinal use over several weeks
- Comparison with existing communication aids
- Evaluation in high-pressure real scenarios (presentations, exams)

---

## 3.3 Ethical Expansion
Any future deployment involving vulnerable populations (e.g., cognitive impairment) will require:
- Formal ethics approval
- Clinical collaboration
- Clear non-diagnostic positioning

---

## 3.4 Deployment Path
The system may be deployed as:
- A Progressive Web App (PWA)
- A mobile wrapper (Flutter / React Native)
- An accessibility-focused academic tool

This phase establishes a transition from prototype to research-grade system.
