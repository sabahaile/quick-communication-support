**## 2.3 Qualitative Feedback**



Open-ended responses revealed recurring themes:



\- Reduced pressure during speech hesitation

\- Increased confidence in academic interaction

\- Appreciation of discreet, non-judgmental support

\- Usefulness for non-native speakers



Example anonymised comments:

\- “It feels like a safety net when my mind freezes.”

\- “I would use this before speaking in class or exams.”

\- “Simple, fast, and not embarrassing.”

\## 2.4 Interpretation



Results suggest that the system successfully supports communication during moments of cognitive or linguistic overload.  

Participants perceived the tool as emotionally supportive rather than intrusive, aligning with human-centred design goals.



These findings justify further refinement and extended evaluation.
