\## 2.2 Quantitative Results (Likert Scale 1–5)



Participants rated the system across usability, usefulness, and emotional comfort.



| Evaluation Dimension     | Mean (1–5 Likert) | Qualitative Interpretation |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Ease of Use              | 4.4               | Very high usability        |
| Speed of Phrase Access   | 4.3               | Very high efficiency       |
| Perceived Usefulness     | 4.2               | High perceived value       |
| Emotional Comfort        | 4.1               | High comfort impact        |
| Willingness to Reuse     | 4.3               | Strong reuse intention     |



Overall, scores indicate strong positive reception, particularly regarding ease of use and relevance in academic stress situations.



**## 2.3 Qualitative Feedback**



Open-ended responses revealed recurring themes:



\- Reduced pressure during speech hesitation

\- Increased confidence in academic interaction

\- Appreciation of discreet, non-judgmental support

\- Usefulness for non-native speakers



Example anonymised comments:

\- “It feels like a safety net when my mind freezes.”

\- “I would use this before speaking in class or exams.”

\- “Simple, fast, and not embarrassing.”

\## 2.4 Interpretation



Results suggest that the system successfully supports communication during moments of cognitive or linguistic overload.  

Participants perceived the tool as emotionally supportive rather than intrusive, aligning with human-centred design goals.



These findings justify further refinement and extended evaluation.
