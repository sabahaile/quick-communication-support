# Phase 2 – User Study and Evaluation

## 2.1 Purpose of the User Study

The purpose of this user study is to evaluate the usability, perceived usefulness, and emotional impact of the *Quick Communication Support* demo.

The demo is designed to support individuals who experience temporary speech hesitation, cognitive overload, or difficulty verbalizing thoughts in high-pressure situations such as lectures, exams, presentations, or social interactions.

This phase focuses on **human-centred evaluation**, rather than clinical diagnosis, and aims to understand:
- Whether the interface is intuitive and low-effort
- Whether the tool reduces communication-related stress
- Whether users perceive value in real academic and social contexts

## 2.2 Participant Group

Participants are recruited from the **UPCT Erasmus and international student community**.

This group is appropriate because:
- Many participants operate in a second or third language
- Academic pressure and public speaking are common
- Cognitive load and communication anxiety are frequent but non-pathological experiences

### Inclusion Criteria
- University students or researchers
- Experience with academic communication (classes, presentations, exams)
- No requirement for diagnosed speech or cognitive conditions

Participation is voluntary and anonymous.

## 2.3 Study Procedure

1. Participants are briefly introduced to the purpose of the demo.
2. Participants interact freely with the demo for several minutes.
3. They explore different contexts (e.g., class, gym, social).
4. Participants complete a structured questionnaire consisting of:
   - Likert-scale questions (1–5)
   - Optional open-ended feedback

The study is conducted informally in-person or remotely using the local demo.

## 2.4 Questionnaire Design

The questionnaire is structured into the following sections:

- **Participant Background** (non-identifying)
- **Usability & Interaction**
- **Perceived Usefulness**
- **Emotional and Cognitive Impact**
- **Overall Evaluation**
- **Optional Open Feedback**

All scaled questions use a **5-point Likert scale**, where:
1 = Strongly Disagree  
5 = Strongly Agree  

This design follows standard Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation practices and allows both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

## 2.5 Evaluation Focus

The study focuses on the following evaluation dimensions:

- Ease of use under stress
- Speed of phrase access
- Emotional comfort and discretion
- Perceived real-world applicability
- Willingness to adopt the tool in daily life

The study does **not** aim to assess clinical effectiveness, but rather perceived support and usability.

---

## 2.6 Ethical Considerations

- No personal identifying data is collected
- No audio or video recordings are used
- Participants may withdraw at any time
- The tool is framed as *supportive*, not medical

Consent is obtained prior to participation.

## 2.7 Expected Outcomes

We expect the study to show that:
- Users find the demo intuitive and low-effort
- Pre-written phrases reduce communication pressure
- The tool is perceived as supportive rather than intrusive
- There is interest in a more developed version

These results will inform future design iterations and larger-scale studies.
